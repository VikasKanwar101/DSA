# ðŸš€ My LeetCode Journey (Synced with LeetSync)

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
This repo has all my LeetCode solutions, automatically synced using [LeetSync](https://github.com/LeetSync/LeetSync).

### ðŸ“‚ Whatâ€™s Inside
- Each folder = 1 problem  
- File name: `solution.cpp`, `solution.py`, etc.  
- Languages I mostly use: **C++**, sometimes **Python**

### ðŸŽ¯ Why Iâ€™m Doing This
- To track my progress
- Revisit old problems & improve solutions
- Build consistency in DSA practice

### ðŸ”„ Auto-Sync?
Yep! Every time I solve a problem on LeetCode, LeetSync pulls it into this repo â€” no manual copy-paste needed ðŸ™Œ
